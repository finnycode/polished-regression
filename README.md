# polished-regression
The most updated version of my linear regression stock model


HOW TO USE:

This program is pretty straightforward to use, just download the code into a folder that alos included a "values.csv" file and run it in your terminal. You can then type in a stock ticker. Then you will be able to type in a value that is how many days it will predict into the future(0, infinite). The porgram will run a linear regression model on the data and add the latest prediction to the file to continue the program. It is a bad idea to put in an values more than 5 as the line becomes extremely biased towards the initial price prediction and often turns into a downard or upwards cycle that provides an innacurate prediction of a future price. Have fun!
